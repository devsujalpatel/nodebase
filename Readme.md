# Nodeflow ⚡

## Workflow automation, but actually not boring.
### Create APIs and workflows just by dragging visual nodes around and letting AI do the heavy lifting. No boilerplate. No “enterprise SaaS for $499/mo” BS. Just build.

## 🚀 What’s the Vibe?

Nodeflow lets you:

Build workflows visually — like Lego for APIs.

Auto-generate logic with AI (your choice of models, your API keys).

Integrate anything — OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, local models, random third-party APIs, whatever.

Basically:
If n8n, Make.com, and Langflow had a child and it actually cared about devs → that’s Nodeflow.

## ✨ Key Features

🎨 Visual Node Editor — Drag, drop, connect, done.

🤖 AI-Powered Node Generation — “I want a message summarizer” and boom — node appears.

🔌 Bring Your Own API Keys — No vendor lock-in. Your models, your creds.

🔗 REST API Output — Turn workflows into actual production APIs.

🏎️ Fast Runtime — No slow workflow engine nonsense.

🛠️ Custom Code Nodes — If you wanna flex, write JS inside nodes.

🧱 Example Use Cases
Use Case	TL;DR
Build chatbot API	Connect ChatCompletion → Format Response → HTTP Output
ETL automations	Fetch → Transform → Store
AI agent pipelines	RAG → LLM → Action Node
Cron workflows	Timer Node → Anything
Prototyping SaaS features	Move fast and don’t hate your life
🏗️ Installation

You already know how to do this, but here:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodeflow
cd nodeflow
pnpm install
pnpm dev


or if you're allergic to pnpm:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now open:

http://localhost:3000


Editor pops up → Go nuts.

🛠️ Add Your AI Keys (Important)

Nodeflow doesn’t force you into a single AI provider.
Just slap your keys in .env like a responsible adult:
```js
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GROQ_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

You can also store them in-project via UI if you prefer clicking things.

🔄 Deploy
```docker
Docker (because of course)

Vercel (if frontend only)

Fly.io or Railway (backend + runtime)

Example Docker:

docker build -t nodeflow .
docker run -p 3000:3000 nodeflow
```

Done.

## 🧍 Who Is This For?

People who hate repetitive coding.

Indie hackers who want to ship faster than corporate interns.

Developers who aren’t scared of using AI the right way.

Anyone tired of juggling webhook spaghetti.

If you scream inside every time you write another Express endpoint →
Nodeflow is therapy.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome. Just don’t send passive-aggressive commit messages like:

“Fix stupid bug”

We’re all tired, but we’re civilized.

⭐ Give a Star If You Don’t Hate It

If this project saved you 10 hours of pain…

### 👉 star the repo.
It's like a high five but digital.

🧘‍♂️ Final Note

This is still evolving. UI will get cleaner. Node library will expand.
But the core idea stays:

Build workflows without touching boilerplate. Focus on logic, not glue code.
